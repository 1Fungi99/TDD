<h1>Preamble</h1>

What makes our team unique and great at TEKSystems is our focus on code quality. We pride ourselves in having a great team with strong engineering practices skills. This focus on strong development and engineering practices skills is why customers choose us as their partner. They don’t want us to just develop some code for them, they want us to build an enterprise quality solution that will support the growth of their business. We believe that you must start with a great foundation that is based on strong engineering practices, code quality and object-oriented design.

As you know the best way to judge an artist/a developer is to see their art/their code. We know that a written or an online technical test is not the ideal right way to evaluate a good developer so we want to give you the opportunity to show us what you can do and who you are as a developer at your own time. Therefore, we would like to give you a small challenge so we can see how you think about object-oriented design and code quality. We know you are probably very busy, and we appreciate the time you will be investing on this, but we believe this is the best way for us to get to know the great developer you are. It helps us maintain and grow our talent pool of great teammates for you to work with.

We are very excited to see what you will come up with.

Practice Manager – Core Development
